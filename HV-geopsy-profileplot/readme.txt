This R script is meant for plotting a 2D HVSR profile from multiple HVSR measurements, processed in GEOPSY software and saved as .hv files.


Input files(examples contained in this folder that should be enough to produce the example_output.jpg image ): 

1) a list of hvfiles to be added to the profile, 

2) a dem csv xyz columns file to recover the topography

3) a file list with coordinates of each HVSR point (or, in alternative, a corresponding .SAF (sesame format) file for each .hv file, with coordinates)


Output: a plot of the profile. (the example_output.jpg image in this folder)


Please, read the comments on the R file to understand what it does. If you have any question or comments, please feel free to open an issue on Github or contact me at andrea.vergnano@posteo.eu

To cite this script in your publication, please refer to me (Andrea Vergnano) and this Github page, and publications of mine (under submission, now at May 2024), for which I wrote this script.


I hope you find it useful!
